- academicStatusesWithCompletionBlock to obtain a list of Mendeley academic status types
- disciplinesWithCompletionBlock to obtain a list of Mendeley discipline types
- createProfile:completionBlock creating a new profile
- updateMyProfile:completionBlock updating an existing profile
Additional Notes:
- createProfile and updateMyProfile use 'special' profile classes. (MendeleyNewProfile and MendeleyAmendmentProfile). This is due to the fact that the expected JSON body in both cases differ in subtle ways from the default profiles JSON body.
- an additional method was added to the MendeleyOAuthProvider (and its MendeleyDefaultOAuthProvider implementation) to authenticate with username and password. This will allow clients to create profiles using the new MendeleyKit methods. 
- clients can ONLY create profiles and/or authenticate with username/password if the client has been approved for this service by the Mendeley team. To apply for your client to be approved visit http://dev.mendeley.com.

## MendeleyKit ##
This is the first public alpha release of MendeleyKit, the Objective-C SDK. Its purpose is to provide clients convenience methods and classes to interface with the Mendeley API.

## Min Requirements ##
- iOS 7.0 or higher
- for development XCode 5 or higher

(support for Mac OSX will be added in a later stage)

## Supported API calls ##

The following APIs are supported in 0.8.1
- /documents
- /folders
- /profiles
- /groups
- /trash
- /profiles
- /annotations
- /catalog: Only GET /catalog (with search params) and GET /catalog/{catalog_id}
- /identifier_types
- /document_types

All supported API calls are defined in MendeleyKit.h

## Not supported API calls ##
The following APIs are not supported in 0.8.1
- /search/catalog
- /enrichments/entities/{file hash}/systems
- create document from file (POST /documents with file/content-type)
- /enrichments/toc/{file hash}
- /disciplines
- /academic_statuses


## Getting started ##
We strongly recommend using cocoapods to include MendeleyKit into your project.
MendeleyKit comes with a MendeleyKit.podspec file.

Your project needs to create a Podfile with the following line in it
```
pod 'MendeleyKit', :git => 'https://github.com/Mendeley/mendeleykit.git'
```

From command line, simply do 
```
pod install
```
For further information on Cocoapods see [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/).

## Registering your app to use with MendeleyKit ##
In order to use MendeleyKit in your client you will need to register your app at the 
[Mendeley API developer portal](http://dev.mendeley.com).

Registering an app will give you
- a client ID
- a client secret
- a redirect URI (this is used during OAuth authentication process)

In your client app, your first call should be to
[[MendeleyKitConfiguration sharedInstance] configureOAuthWithParameters:parameters];

where parameters is a dictionary containing the following key/value pairs
- kMendeleyOAuth2ClientIDKey : <your client ID>
- kMendeleyOAuth2ClientSecretKey : <your client secret>
- kMendeleyOAuth2RedirectURLKey : <your redirect URI>

## Using MendeleyKit ##
the Kit comes with example code to help you on your way

- Login process: MendeleyKit provides a MendeleyLoginController (UIViewController). This helper class provides users with the necessary web-access to authenticate on Mendeley. An example for this is provided in the ViewController.class in the MendeleyKitExample project

- MendeleyKit defines all supported API calls. All client calls should be made through methods defined in MendeleyKit

- as is usual these days, most methods in MendeleyKit make use of block based structure.

Examples obtaining a list of documents with specified query parameters
```
- (void)documentListWithQueryParameters:(MendeleyDocumentParameters *)queryParameters
                        completionBlock:(MendeleyArrayCompletionBlock)completionBlock;
```
